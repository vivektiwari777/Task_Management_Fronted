// Task Management System - Overview
// I developed a Task Management System using React.js for the frontend and Node.js (Express.js) for the backend.
// The system is designed to help teams efficiently manage, track, and collaborate on tasks.
// The app features real-time updates, AI-powered task breakdowns, and a secure authentication system.


// Frontend
// The frontend is built with React.js and styled using Tailwind CSS.
// It provides a clean, user-friendly interface that allows users to create, assign, update, and track tasks in real-time.
// The frontend is deployed on Vercel, and you can access it via this link:

// AI Integration - Task Management System
// For task breakdown and task suggestions, I integrated the Gemini AI API into the system.
// The AI helps automatically generate sub-tasks and provides task suggestions, making it easier for users to plan and manage their workload effectively.
// This integration saves time and ensures that tasks are broken down into manageable steps.
